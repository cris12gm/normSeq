                                    The ever-expending development of various RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods has drastically increased the possibilities of performing diverse direct quantitative analysis of the transcriptome in large biological datasets. This has revealed compelling details about various small RNA populations like miRNAs and tRNAs. The selection of appropriate processing pipelines and normalization strategies for these large datasets are key to preserve the complexity of gene expression patterns in biological samples. However, experimental noise resulting from the inherent variability in the generation of RNA-seq data often hinders accurate quantification and analysis of true differences in RNA expression. Data normalization, in particular, is a critical step enabling the meaningful comparison and interpretation of these high-throughput datasets.

                                    Our freely accessible webserver tool aims for reproducible analysis and visualization of high-throughput RNAseq data by offering rapid evaluation and selection between 9 commonly used RNA-seq normalization methods. Both, mRNA gene expression datasets as well as small RNA, like miRNA and tRNA, expression datasets can be applied for data normalization, batch-effect correction and differential expression analysis with multiple visualization options and downloadable output plots and tables. Our platform enables researchers a better evaluation and selection of their normalization method and increased flexibility for downstream analyses.
